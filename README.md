#### Password Crackers
Password Crackers	Password cracking tools are often referred to as password recovery tools and can be used to crack or recover a password. This is accomplished either by removing the original password, after bypassing the data encryption, or by outright discovery of the password. Password crackers repeatedly make guesses in order to crack the password. Examples of password cracking tools include John the Ripper, Ophcrack, L0phtCrack, THC Hydra, RainbowCrack, and Medusa.

#### Wireless Hacking Tools
Wireless hacking tools are used to intentionally hack into a wireless network to detect security vulnerabilities. Examples of wireless hacking tools include Aircrack-ng, Kismet, InSSIDer, KisMAC, Firesheep, and NetStumbler.

#### Network Scanning and Hacking Tools
Network scanning tools are used to probe network devices, servers, and hosts for open TCP or UDP ports. Examples of scanning tools include Nmap, SuperScan, Angry IP Scanner, and NetScanTools.

#### Packet Crafting Tools
These tools are used to probe and test a firewall’s robustness using specially crafted forged packets. Examples include Hping, Scapy, Socat, Yersinia, Netcat, Nping, and Nemesis.

#### Packet Sniffers
These tools are used to capture and analyze packets within traditional Ethernet LANs or WLANs. Tools include Wireshark, Tcpdump, Ettercap, Dsniff, EtherApe, Paros, Fiddler, Ratproxy, and SSLstrip.

#### Rootkit Detectors
This is a directory and file integrity checker used by white hats to detect installed root kits. Example tools include AIDE, Netfilter, and PF: OpenBSD Packet Filter.

#### Fuzzers to Search Vulnerabilities
Fuzzers are tools used by threat actors to discover a computer’s security vulnerabilities. Examples of fuzzers include Skipfish, Wapiti, and W3af.

#### Forensic Tools	These tools are used by white hat hackers to sniff out any trace of evidence existing in a computer. Example of tools include Sleuth Kit, Helix, Maltego, and Encase.

#### Debuggers
These tools are used by black hats to reverse engineer binary files when writing exploits. They are also used by white hats when analyzing malware. Debugging tools include GDB, WinDbg, IDA Pro, and Immunity Debugger.

#### Hacking Operating Systems
These are specially designed operating systems preloaded with tools optimized for hacking. Examples of specially designed hacking operating systems include Kali Linux, Knoppix, BackBox Linux.

#### Encryption Tools
Encryption tools use algorithm schemes to encode the data to prevent unauthorized access to the encrypted data. Examples of these tools include VeraCrypt, CipherShed, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, Tor, OpenVPN, and Stunnel.

#### Vulnerability Exploitation Tools
These tools identify whether a remote host is vulnerable to a security attack. Examples of vulnerability exploitation tools include Metasploit, Core Impact, Sqlmap, Social Engineer Toolkit, and Netsparker.

#### Vulnerability Scanners
These tools scan a network or system to identify open ports. They can also be used to scan for known vulnerabilities and scan VMs, BYOD devices, and client databases. Examples of tools include Nipper, Secunia PSI, Core Impact, Nessus v6, SAINT, and Open VAS.
